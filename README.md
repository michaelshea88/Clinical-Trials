## Data mining 40,000+ oncology studies on ClinicalTrials.gov

[ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) is a government-funded registry of over 200,000 clinical trials of drugs and medical devices. Starting in 2007, virtually all major studies that have at least one open site in the United States are required by law to be registered on the site. This repo contains exploratory data analysis on 40,000 oncology trials downloaded in August, 2016.

      <p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> is a government-funded registry of over 200,000 clinical studies of drugs, biologics and medical devices. Since 2007, most studies with at least one site in the United States have been required by law to be registered.</p>

<p>The site is maintained by the National Institutes of Health and lists studies conducted in all 50 states and 192 countries. Entries for each trial contain a detailed description of the conditions, interventions and outcomes being studied, as well as the study design, enrollment and funding sources. All data on ClinicalTrials.gov is publicly available, and the siteâ€™s direct download feature makes it easy to analyze the results of a given search.</p>
<p>We searched the registry for all oncology-related trials with start dates from January 2007 to August 2016 and found over 40,000 trials that listed among the conditions studied one of the following search terms: "carcinoma", "neoplasm", "cancer", "leukemia", "lymphoma", or "oncology". We then came up with a few questions that we hoped the data could shed light on. The goal is to provide patients and researchers a general overview of the clinical development landscape in oncology.</p>

      <p>The chart above shows the number of trials registered every month between 2007 and 2016. As you can see, there's a general upward trend. The first spike in 2007 is due to new trial reporting requirements put in place by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, which stipulated that a broader swath of clinical trials had to be listed on the registry.</p>

      <p>The dataset consists predominantly of interventional drug trials, as shown in the chart above, although a significant number of observational studies are also listed, as well as trials for medical procedures and devices. As for the recruitment status of the trials in the data set, about two-thirds of trials analyzed have been completed or are currently recruiting participants.</p>
      <h1>Which cancer types have received the most attention?</h1>
<p>Not surprisingly, breast cancer was the most commonly studied tumor site. Most other major cancer types are listed in the chart below, including both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.</p>

<h1>How has the study of different cancer types changed over time?</h1>
<p>The chart below shows that the number of trials conducted per year for most of the common tumor types has increased. Interestingly, the only two cancer types that did not experience an increase in study were blood cancers. Both leukemias and lymphomas were studied slightly more in 2007 than 2015.</p>

<h1>Which anti-cancer drugs have been studied the most?</h1>
<p>The chart below demonstrates that chemotherapies have been studied far more often than targeted agents, largely because the same chemotherapies are often used in the control arms of randomized studies, and in many instances, represent the standard of care against which new drugs are evaluated.</p>

<h1>Which institutions have sponsored the most trials?</h1>
<p>We looked at the top 40 trial sponsors that were listed as lead sponsors in the registry, meaning they were the organization or person who oversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyzing the study data. We then compared the number of trials for which they were lead sponsor and the number of trials for which they were a collaborator, meaning they were listed as a sponsor, but not the lead sponsor. Although the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has the highest total number of trials, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center actually served as lead sponsor on more trials.</p>

<h1>Do certain institutions specialize in different areas?</h1>
<p>Here we looked at the top forty sponsors again, this time by the number of trials for the cancer they studied most as lead sponsor. This provides a snapshot of the varying areas of focus of different institutions.</p>

<h1>What trial phases are most common?</h1>
<p>The phases, or stages of clinical development, of trials in the data set are shown below. The typical clinical developpment process consists of Phase 1 trials to establish preliminary safety data, then Phase 2 trials to further investigate safety and obtain preliminary efficacy data, and finally Phase 3 studies, which seek to generate enough evidence of effectiveness to support marketing approval. Phase 4 trials are conducted in the post-market setting if the FDA requires further studies to take place. There are also trials with combined phases, such as Phase 1-2 trials, which seek to speed up the development process. It is important to note that there are likely many more Phase 1 oncology studies than are visible on the chart below, due to clinical trial reporting requirements that exclude certain Phase 1 studies, including studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes.</p>

<h1>How does the source of funding affect what phase of development is sponsored?</h1>
<p>The chart below shows the relationship between the source of a trial's funding and the phase of the trial. Often trials are funded by a single source, such as a pharmaceutical company or the NIH. However, in many other cases, trials are funded through public-private partnerships. The most common public-private partnerships are also displayed below.</p>

<h1>What is the distribution of study enrollment?</h1>
<p>Due to the presence of massive outliers (46 trials in the dataset had an enrollment in excess of 100,000; 19 trials had reported over 500,000 participants), the distribution of trial size shown below is cut into arbitrary groups in a way that is intended to be most informative. What's striking is the sheer number of trials enrolling (or claiming to enroll) fewer than 30 participants.</p>

<h1>How has trial size changed over time?</h1>
<p>Phase 3 trials have gotten smaller by about 130 patients over the past nine years. Also of note is the similarity in size between Phase 1 and 2 trials.

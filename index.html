      <p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> is a government-funded registry of over 200,000 clinical trials. Since 2007, virtually all major studies of drugs and biologics have been required by law to be registered on the site.</p>

<p>The site is maintained by the National Institutes of Health and lists studies conducted in all 50 states and 192 countries. Each trial page contains a detailed description of the conditions, interventions and outcomes being studied, as well as the study design, enrollment and funding sources. For example, <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02154490?term=lung+map&amp;rank=1">here</a> is the page dedicated to Lung-MAP, a trial currently being overseen by Friends of Cancer Research ( additional information about the trial can be found at <a href="www.lung-map.org">www.lung-map.org</a>).</p>

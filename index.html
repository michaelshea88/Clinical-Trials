      <p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> is a government-funded registry of over 200,000 clinical trials. Since 2007, virtually all major studies of drugs and biologics have been required by law to be registered on the site.</p>

<p>The site is maintained by the National Institutes of Health and lists studies conducted in all 50 states and 192 countries. Each trial page contains a detailed description of the conditions, interventions and outcomes being studied, as well as the study design, enrollment and funding sources. For example, <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02154490?term=lung+map&amp;rank=1">here</a> is the page dedicated to Lung-MAP, a trial currently being overseen by Friends of Cancer Research ( additional information about the trial can be found at <a href="www.lung-map.org">www.lung-map.org</a>).</p>
<p>All data on ClinicalTrials.gov is publicly available, and the siteâ€™s direct download feature makes it easy to analyze the results of a given search. We searched the registry for all oncology-related trials with start dates from January 2007-present. We found over 40,000 oncology-related trials from the site and came up with a few questions that we hoped the data could shed light on. The goal is to provide a general overview of the clinical development landscape in oncology.</p>
<h1>Which cancer types have received the most attention?</h1>
<p>Not surprisingly, breast cancer was the most commonly studied cancer. Only common cancers are listed in the chart below, and it should be noted a large portion of cancer drug development in recent years has been targeted at rare cancers.</p>
